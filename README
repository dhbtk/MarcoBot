Marco is my little bot. He can do lots of wonderful stuff, but some of his
features are broken, notably the FaiDwiki. I could use thine help.

Install instructions:
1. Create a folder for macros and karma storage. For example, "/home/your
username/.marcobot"
2. Create the folder /var/log/marcobot/ and /var/log/marcobot/logs/. He
must have rw rights to these folders.
3. Fill in the sample marcobotrc and put it in a folder, preferably the
same one that you use for macros and karma.
4. Run "init.sh" in the macros and karma folder.
5. Call him with "marcobot /path/to/marcobotrc"
6. Test him, improve him, report bugs
7. ???
8. Profit!
